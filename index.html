        <p class="lead mb-4">Throughout high school, I was committed to making an impact in my community and serving those around me. I founded the Soup Kitchen Club in my school and worked towards supporting the homeless community. I held donation drives, provided volunteer opportunities at shelters and soup kitchens, and educated the public on homelessness along with the club members. As a club, we obtained 300 pounds of food and 27 bags of clothing for a local shelter and worked closely with businesses to provide for the homeless population. I worked collaboratively with the board and members to ensure a productive and fulfilling environment. I also conducted workshops in my community and reached out to local businesses with my plan to acquire a water station for a local homeless shelter. My pitch included 7 weeks of advocacy on environmental challenges such as reducing plastic usage, specifically in homeless shelters. I raised a total of $2,500, giving me sufficient funds to install a reliable water station. With these donations, I was also able to buy reusable water bottles for each guest, significantly reducing the dependence on single-use plastic water bottles. I earned the Girl Scouts Gold Award which is the highest award a girl scout can earn through this work.
<br><br>

         Additionally, I was also part of the National Honor Society and spent countless hours volunteering at school events such as the Special Olympics where I was in charge of organizing activities for students who were part of the Special Education Department. Through my volunteer service, I earned the Congressional Gold Award which requires a minimum of 400 hours of voluntary public service, 200 hours of personal development, and 200 hours of physical fitness, and is awarded by the United States Congress. I was also a part of the Newbury Park High School girlsâ€™ tennis team and dedicated after-school hours and weekends to practices and matches. I organized team bonding events and encouraged my fellow teammates as we worked towards a common goal.
<br><br>

        Lastly, I joined the Ventura County Medical Explorers Post 911 medical exposure program in my junior year of high school and was committed to learning about the medical field. I earned the squad captain position and looked over the other members. Considering my role was to direct and train members of my squad, communication was fundamental. I wanted everyone to know their participation was greatly valued, so I led regular meetings to gather my squad together and hear their feedback on the Post. Through this program I was able to get research assistant opportunities and internships at medical hospitals.
